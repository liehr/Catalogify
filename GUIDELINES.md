# Git Branching Guidelines üöÄ

Welcome to our Git branching guidelines! Follow these standards to maintain an organized and efficient development workflow in your Git repository.

## 1. Branch Naming Convention üè∑Ô∏è

- **Feature Branches:** Prefix feature branches with `feature/` followed by a descriptive name, e.g., `feature/user-authentication`.
- **Bugfix Branches:** Prefix bugfix branches with `bugfix/` followed by the corresponding issue number, e.g., `bugfix/123`.
- **Release Branches:** Prefix release branches with `release/` followed by the version number, e.g., `release/v1.0`.
- **Hotfix Branches:** Prefix hotfix branches with `hotfix/` followed by a brief description, e.g., `hotfix/security-fix`.

## 2. Branch Management üå±

- **Main Branches:**
    - **master:** Represents the stable version of the project, ready for deployment.
    - **develop:** Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development work.
- **Temporary Branches:**
    - Create feature, bugfix, release, or hotfix branches for specific tasks or issues.
    - Delete branches after merging to maintain a clean repository.

## 3. Workflow üîÑ

1. **Create Branch:**
    - Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create a new branch based on the task being performed.

2. **Development:**
    - Work on the assigned task within the branch, making regular commits to track progress.

3. **Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test the changes within the branch to ensure functionality and integrity.

4. **Code Review:**
    - If applicable, initiate a pull request for review by peers or perform a self-review before merging.

5. **Merge Branch:**
    - Merge the branch into the appropriate main branch (`develop`, `master`, etc.) using `git merge`.
    - Resolve any merge conflicts promptly.

## 4. Additional Considerations ü§î

- **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Provide clear and concise commit messages summarizing the changes made.
- **Remote Repository Interaction:** Push branches to the remote repository to facilitate collaboration and backup.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep main branches (`master`, `develop`) up to date by merging changes frequently.
- **Utilize Git Tools:** Leverage GitKraken, GitHub, or similar tools for visualizing branching history and managing workflow.

## 5. Documentation üìö

- **README:** Include a comprehensive README file detailing the branching strategy and guidelines for contributors.
- **Wiki or Documentation:** Maintain additional documentation or a wiki within the repository for more extensive guidelines and explanations.

These guidelines aim to streamline development processes, foster collaboration, and maintain a well-organized Git repository. Adhering to these standards ensures clarity, consistency, and efficiency in version control and code management.
